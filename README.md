This is my modified version of the tutorial Introduction to Unity Scripting. I have finished both part 1 and 2, added background music to the title and game scenes and a winning screen when the player saves 20 sheep.

There is a build version with which you can play the game in the folder Builds, named Sheep Rescue.exe.
